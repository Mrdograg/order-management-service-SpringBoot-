üçï Food Orders Service
üìñ Description

This project is a Spring Boot microservice for managing food orders. It provides REST APIs to place, track, and update food orders, while also integrating with AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service) for asynchronous order processing.

The main features include:

Creating and retrieving customer food orders

Paginated order listing with filters (page, size, sort)

Updating order status (e.g., PLACED, PROCESSED, DELIVERED)

Sending order events to an AWS SQS queue for further processing (e.g., payment service, delivery service)

Using MySQL for data persistence with JPA/Hibernate

Following clean layered architecture with Controllers, Services, DTOs, and Configs

This project was built as a backend service for a food delivery system and demonstrates real-world enterprise practices:

Environment variables for secrets (AWS credentials)

Database migrations with Flyway (optional)

Modular and testable Spring Boot structure

Local Setup

Create MySQL DB

CREATE DATABASE foodorders;


Configure Database & AWS in application.properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/foodorders
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
sqs.queue.url=https://sqs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/1234567890/food-orders-queue
aws.region=ap-south-1
aws.accessKeyId=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
